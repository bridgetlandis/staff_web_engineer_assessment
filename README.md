# staff_web_engineer_assessment

The purpose of this assessment to assess your ability to architect an application from the ground up.  The look of the application is not important but it should be somewhat visually appealing. 

We will be looking at cleaniness, that the below points have been completed, tests are written and overall architecture.

Create an Rails application that does the following: 
1. Has a React front-end 
2. Displays a list of fake providers 
3. Displays the providers ability (hourly appointments - 8am - 5pm up to 30 days out)
4. Uses a calendar widget
5. Uses the following API to display a photo of the provider: https://placekitten.com/ (feel free to be creative with another API for photos)
6. Allows a patient to book an appointment - gathering only the following data: first name, last name, dob and email
7. Sends an email confirmation that the appointment is scheduled with the provider
8. Has comprehensive tests
